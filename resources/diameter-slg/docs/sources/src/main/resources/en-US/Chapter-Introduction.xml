    <para>Events represent messages received by the Diameter stack. Different events types are specified for each
        Diameter request or answer. Events are fired either on client or server activities.
    </para>
    <para>The Activities are defined by <acronym>RA</acronym> Type to ease use of <acronym>RA</acronym>. Activities
        represent Diameter session between two peers. <acronym>SLEE</acronym> applications use activities to create,
        send and receive messages.
